# testex
A tiny REPL for testing Python regular expressions.

- Use "?" to see the string you are testing
- Use "set" to set the string to something else

## Why?

I use tools like [regex101](https://regex101.com/) for testing regular
expressions, but I hate waiting on a web browser to open for such a
tiny task. Thus: Testex.
